Thanks for visiting! This Repo serves 2 purposes. First and foremost, to help others. Second, this is a place to show my capabilities to prospective clients, partners, and employers.

Pre-reqs:
  1) I published my work in Jupyter Notebooks.
  2) I am using Python 3.12
  3) I am storing my API keys in a .env file on my hosts, not in my notebooks. I HIGHLY suggest you do the same for security purposes.
     Example .ENV file:

OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIzaxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

Then reference them like I do in my code.
